For visually impaired youth, the lack of accessible career guidance is not just an inconvenience, it is a barrier to independence. Without tailored support, navigating the job market breeds insecurity and often leads to unemployment.
Visionary AI is rooted in a successful 2024 pilot project implemented within the framework of the Vietnam AI for Education Program (VAIEP) at a specialized center for visually impaired children in Tay Ninh. The initial solution involved an AI chatbot built within ChatGPT to provide a structured path for students to reflect on and deduce their own strengths. The project equipped 3 specialized teachers with AI foundation skills and prompt engineering techniques and was launched for students from Grade 8 and above. 
Visionary AI empowers visually impaired youth in Vietnam to transition from dependency to professional independence. We address the systemic lack of accessible career guidance by deploying a Voice-First Intelligent Companion. Grounded in a successful 2024 pilot, our solution provides a 4-step roadmap: independent self-discovery, data-driven market exploration, personalized action planning, and job readiness training. Unlike traditional models, we utilize a Multi-Agent AI architecture to deliver a scalable, barrier-free experience, ensuring that every visually impaired student can confidently declare: "I know who I am, and I define my own future."
